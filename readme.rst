My .vimrc and plugins
#####################

What is this?
=============

Recently I have been dealing with system changes, corruption of hard-drives, 
you name it..

Anyway, to save myself from the tedious process of setting up vim, I have 
written this script.

How do I get your .vimrc?
=========================

Just type

    ./set_up.zsh

into your shell, in this very directory, and you are golden.
